<b> Guess - PWN 50 </b> <br> <br>
 This challenge contains format string vuln and a hint is given that flag is hidden somewhere <br> 
 So i wrote a bruteforce code to leak the stack using Direct paramtere access  <br>
 and at last got a flag but some parts were missing .. coz it was 64 bit binary <br>
 so we had to use $lx ... and finally got the flag <br>
