## 1) Hackon Mini pwn50 

The binary spits out the seed for us we just feed that to our srand glibc func and get the random value hence the flag 

```python
from pwn import *
from ctypes import *

cdll.LoadLibrary("libc.so.6") 
libc = CDLL("libc.so.6")

r = remote("35.154.158.26",31339)

msg = r.recvline()
print msg 
seed = msg.split(':')[1]
seed = int(seed)
print "[+] seed : "+str(seed)

libc.srand(seed)
val = libc.rand()

print "[+] random val :"+str(val)

r.sendline(str(val))

print r.recvlines(2)

```

## 2) BITSCTF Random game 
 i didin't solve the problem but solution is :
  the binary uses time(0) as seed which i learnt is same for everyone (it is just a no of seconds since epoch)
  so same idea as above and then flag :)
